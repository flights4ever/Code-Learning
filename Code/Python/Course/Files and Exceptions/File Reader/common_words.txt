Almost two million people in north-east England are expected to face local restrictions as coronavirus cases rise.
Areas including Newcastle, Sunderland and County Durham are due to be put under the new measures.
These are expected to include restrictions on households mixing and pubs being ordered to close earlier.
It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Sun: "The only way to make sure the country is able to enjoy Christmas is to be tough now."
Mr Johnson previously said the government was doing "everything in our power" to avoid another nationwide lockdown.

    PM: Second national lockdown would be 'disastrous'
    Which areas are now under local lockdown?

A full announcement detailing the new measures for the North East is expected later on Thursday.
MPs from the area met with Health Minister Nadine Dorries on Wednesday evening.
The MPs were told the lockdown measures would apply in Newcastle, South Tyneside, Sunderland, Northumberland and County Durham, said BBC Newsnight political editor Nicholas Watt.
He said a Labour MP told him measures would include pubs closing at 22:00 BST, no mixing with other households and public transport only for essential travel.
'Not a full lockdown'
Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said it was hoped the temporary measures would prevent a "full lockdown".
In a series of tweets, Mr Forbes denied that the new restrictions meant the area was headed for "lockdown" - and it was "about re-introducing social distancing where the evidence says it is slipping".

The North East has seen a resurgence of coronavirus in recent weeks and four boroughs were last week placed on the government's watchlist for areas needing "enhanced support".
On Monday, councils in seven areas - Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Gateshead, County Durham and Sunderland - called for new restrictions.
BBC analysis of the government's figures shows that as of Wednesday, Bolton had the highest rate in England at 204.1 per 100,000 people in the week to 13 September.
Sunderland's rate was 82.1 per 100,000 people, South Tyneside was 93.4, Gateshead was 81.7, Newcastle was 64.1, North Tyneside was 46.7, with County Durham at 37.4 and Northumberland at 25.7.
In total there were 1,106 new cases in a seven-day period.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: "We constantly monitor infection rates across the country and keep all measures under review in consultation with local leaders.
"Any changes to local restrictions will be announced in the usual way."

Other parts of the UK, including Birmingham and Greater Manchester, are already subject to increased measures.
In an interview with the Sun newspaper on Thursday, Mr Johnson compared the graph showing UK virus cases to the humps on a camel's back, saying the aim is to "stop the surge" in cases and "flatten the second hump".
He said he did not want to lock down sections of the economy, but that the government "will be looking at" requiring pubs to close early.
On Wednesday, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs a second national lockdown would be potentially "disastrous" for the UK.
He admitted there was not enough testing capacity - amid widespread reports of difficulties obtaining them - and said new nationwide restrictions such as the "rule of six" were necessary to "defeat" the disease.
Coronavirus cases across the UK increased by 3,991, taking the total to 378,219, according to figures from the government.
